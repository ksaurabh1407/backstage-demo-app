# Documentation for Backstage Demo App

This is a simple Flask application that defines an API endpoint.
The endpoint returns a JSON response with hostname when the endpoint http://localhost:5000/api/v1/details is accessed.
The application is set to run in debug mode, which is useful for development.
The endpoint is defined using the @app.route decorator, which maps the URL to the function.
The function get_details returns a dictionary with hostname information.
The Flask application is created using the Flask class, and the app.run() method starts the server.
The application is designed to be run as a standalone script, and the if __name__ == '__main__': block ensures that the server starts only when the script is executed directly.
The application can be accessed at http://localhost:5000/api/v1/details in a web browser or using tools like Postman or curl.
The response will be in JSON format, which is a common data interchange format used in web APIs.
The application can be extended by adding more routes and functionality as needed.
The application can be tested using unit tests or integration tests to ensure that the API behaves as expected.
